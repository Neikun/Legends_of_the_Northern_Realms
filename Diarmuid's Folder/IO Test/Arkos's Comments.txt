Ok, Diarmuid, your IO test between two dungeons was FREAKN AWESOME!  I actually went to the 2nd dungeon not realizing I needed a scroll from the first.  The ax and torch from the 1st dungeon
came with me to the 2nd dungeon!  I went back to the first from the 2nd and everything was how I left it! But this time I had throwing axes from the 2nd dungeon to use in the first! 
Absolutely insane man, I had sooo much fun!

Wow!  So now I'm seeing how powerful this is!  All these .dat's combined to be one dungeon!  
I have to find a relic in the north to open some door in the Xafi desert... the puzzles and expansiveness is unlimited with your IO test demonstration.  I'm blown away!  Love it!
Also, the game play in your demonstration was perfect!  Having to get a key in the 2nd dungeon to open a door in the first dungeon - awesome prize at the end!
