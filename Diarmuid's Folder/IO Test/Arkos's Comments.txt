Ok, Diarmuid, your IO test between two dungeons was FREAKN AWESOME!  I actually went to the 2nd dungeon not realizing I needed a scroll from the first.  The ax and torch from the 1st dungeon
came with me to the 2nd dungeon!  I went back to the first from the 2nd and everything was how I left it! But this time I had throwing axes from the 2nd dungeon to use in the first! 
Absolutely insane man, I had sooo much fun!
