This is a workin io test.
=========================

Start in IO dungeon 1, and see if you can find the goromog statuette in IO dungeon 2!

To transfer between dungeons, you must go back to the exit and receive the "save data exported" message.
Then: - Save your game
- Return to main menu
- Custom Dungeon -> the other dungon
- Choose "import" and select the save you just made.

Everything in the dungeon should be as you left it, doors, items, monsters, puzzles....
