I suggest we focus on a new architecture to take advanatage of Diarmuid’s import system to create even more immersion and open-world feel.  
May we create a hybrid of Mahric’s fast travel for long distances with other open world dungeon levels.  Let’s push the envelope!

[10:29:14 AM] Eric Krauss: No need for annoying story excuses for losing the party's equipment now
[10:48:13 AM] Georges Dimitrov: While I get my git working, here's what I suggest:
[10:48:14 AM] Georges Dimitrov: We can also store which dungeons were completed or not.

Now we cannot save entire dungeon states, but I think that we should have two categories:
- The Core World Module, such as the main town, or the Library, to which you return frequently. 
For this we should save a lot of data on everything what was done: items that were picked up should not reappear 
(they can be either spawned if NOT picked up, or destroyed if already picked up), doors could stay open, npcs should remember what you did with them, etc.

- Standalone dungeons that you travel to and back, and normally not return to: in those, if you return to the dungeon, you would have it all reset, 
except maybe for key quest items that we would check. So if you go to a cave to retreive an old relic for the quest, exit and go back again, 
you would find all weapons/monsters/keys/puzzles reset, but if you picked up the relic it wouldn't be on its altar anymore.
[1:12:45 PM] Georges Dimitrov: Ah and by the way, don't worry for me and the serialization functions, it was much easier than I thought.
