Reborn God

This is the starting point for a set of quests that have to do with a forgotten god that chooses the party to act as it's ambassadors and return it to it's former glory.

The questline begins with the party discovering an abandoned, run-down shrine they intend to loot. They find it to be empty, but are approached by an apparently divine entity which informs he/she is an ancestral local deity. His power was stolen as his idols were taken from the shrine many generations ago. The idols (any number between 3 and, say, 8) are held by different people: a deranged cult, a rich merchant, an abandoned castle/dungeon and so on. If they are returned to the temple, the deity regains control of the surrounding lands and rewards the party for their exploits in some manner, and also benefits the locals who subsequently revere the champions as saints of some kind.

This is the bare essence of the idea -- in practice it could be anything like this.
