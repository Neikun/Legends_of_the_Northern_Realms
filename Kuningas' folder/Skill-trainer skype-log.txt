[19:34:51 | Edited 19:38:25] msyblade: ie :More protection, but weaker attack. Then the player could make a "Tank" fighter, or a Damage dealing fighter with less protection depending on the curses they "Choose" Almost like New Sub-Classes!

[19:35:54] Kuningas: Another way for that (more customization) could be skill trainers in towns and maybe even dungeons.

[19:36:10] Kuningas: But I'm not sure about the mechanical side

[19:36:23] drakkkan: trainers I like. if we will have some curency I think raising some points for gold is always fine

[19:36:23] msyblade: Ooooooh, raise a skill with hard earned cash/treasure

[19:36:42] msyblade: or remove curse

[19:36:45] drakkkan: mechanical side = very easy. you can just buy tomes of... from trainers :)

[19:36:54] Kuningas: That in it's simplest.

[19:37:11] Kuningas: And maybe a few secret skills only available in certain dungeons.

[19:37:22] msyblade: I LIKE it

[19:37:25] Kuningas: Not necessarily more powerful, just more specialized
