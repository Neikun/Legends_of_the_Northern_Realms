I felt the inspiration, so I whipped this up.

When researching snake-mythology, I remembered the nordic and germanic people often put their runes inside snakes, so I thought of our dragon statue. I was also inspired by the tale of the Piraeus Lion, which was a lion statue located in Piraeus Harbor (in Greece I believe) when vikings happened upon it and left some badass graffiti. A picture of the lion also enclosed. This is a quick draft of what I was thinking.

Notes:
-Sort of based on the dragon statue (can also be a dragon, of course -- dragon is more fitting to the south)
-The runic text should be gold like some of it is in-game
-It should be readable -- a more stylish wall-text or signpost to be precise.
-Most fitting if we end up starting from the north trading route (or a dragon if we base on south)

Also I feel kind of bad to appear to be forcing my weird, snake related ideas, but that is not the case, I think this could be cool even otherwise. It is also sort of recognisable for people who have played the regular Grimrock.
