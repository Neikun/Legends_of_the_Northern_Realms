Serpent -- Immortal destroyer

On my wide travels I have spied on many a strange ritual, and scarce are they stranger than the rites that honor --or ward off-- the serpent, most devious of nature's inhabitants. After seeing the temple of the snake-god in the jungles of Xaae, and observing grim Northerners curse the world eating worm Midgormun, I became interested in the myths surrounding this creature in the cultures surrounding us.
What I found out is covered in this treatise. I will be moving from north to south.


Midgormun, the eater of the world

When I was around the great Fjords , I saw very few pictures of snakes (save dragons, but the myth is unrelated in their culture) anywhere. Only the time when we were in a narrow fjord fighting a malicious wind that took one of the boats I heard the men utter the name of Midgormun as a curse as they watched their comrades disappear in the rocky waves. I later asked them who was Midgormun, to hear he was the the poisonous snake-god that resides in the deepest parts of the ocean, causing storms and eating ships. He was also blamed for siring the land-dwelling vipers, the only snake species found in that northern land. It is also the most poisonous of all the animals that live in those conditions, which explains it's hated status.

I said I did not see any art depicting this god, but they said some of the witches and warlocks think the great worm will gift it's followers with immortality when it eats the world like it was phropecied to.
There was also once a great king in the north, who is now only known as the Great Northern Serpent -- I was unable to find much information on this mysterious character, save that he was buried in a secret place with the cursed crown he bore on his forehead. The men who buried him jumped from the cliffs to Midgormun's deep realm to keep the secret safe forever.

It is said the settlement of Ormun is named after the snakes that are abundant in it's rocky landscapes, but I have not visited that place. I heard the locals ward off snakes with queer practices, I must travel there one day.

Souther, near Kalevala, people don't seem to have an established snake cult, owing to their belief that the snake is the most deceitful of all animals, and thus can never be trusted with sacrifices or worship.  It is said that local sorcerers once enchanted snakes into their fences for protection from outsiders, and wield magical snake-shaped staffs that could inflict terrible illnesses on their foes. Their interesting Farnorth-myth also says that great snakes live there. One of the great heroic deeds depicted in their epics is to plow a field infested with poisonous snakes. The land-dwelling viper is the only worm to inhabit these lands as well.

I also heard a story in a small village about snakes living in whirlpools that form into streams -- an interesting notion no doubt connected to the Midgormun myth.

Kuningas notes: Midgormund is ever so slightly based on Jormungandir of the Norse Mythology, but I tried to keep it to the minimum. The Kalevalan part is based on Finnish Mythology -- much less subtle but just as delicious.
