--FEATURE SUGGESTION (for scripters)
  Skill-system, with trainers in towns and perhaps hidden in dungeons,   that can teach new skills, or maybe just sell skill tomes for a really   high price. Perhaps also cheaper, but temporary buffs to certain   skills. Some special skills could be hidden in certain dungeons.

--FEATURE REQUEST/SUGGESTION (for the devs, I suppose):
  Camera controls for scripting, if ever possible!
  We could make short camera drives that would enable, among other   things: diagonal/curved movement (in certain places), elevation changes   (temporary or permament), crawlspaces, etc...
  I've mentioned this before, but I've not got any comments, and I think   this would have almost as game-changing qualities as GUI controls,   which we now have.

  Is this worth asking from Almost Human?

--ORMUND: A rocky area, abundant with snakes.

--I think this has been considered, although I've not participated in the   discussion, at least not yet. I was wondering if we've thought about a   champion hiring or a party forming mechanic? Some dungeoneering games   had a temple or a tavern where you could hire heroes for your party. Is   this (yet?) possible in Grimrock?

  I think I saw something relating to this in the skype chat. It is not   the most urgent of things, but it is a thought.

--Well, I suppose I suggest that Ranwyn is a big enough city to have   sewers.
