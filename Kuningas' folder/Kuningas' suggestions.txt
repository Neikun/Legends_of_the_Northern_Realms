ORMUND: A rocky area, abundant with snakes.



NEW SUGGESTION / THOUGHT:
I think this has been considered, although I've not participated in the discussion, at least not yet. I was wondering if we've thought about a champion hiring or a party forming mechanic? Some dungeoneering games had a temple or a tavern where you could hire heroes for your party. Is this (yet?) possible in Grimrock?

I think I saw something relating to this in the skype chat. It is not the most urgent of things, but it is a thought.

OLD:

Well, I suppose I suggest that Ranwyn is a big enough city to have sewers.
