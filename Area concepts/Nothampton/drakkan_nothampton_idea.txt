Nothampton -
Actually the only city where "north" and "south" culture live together. Huge harbor as well. Perhaps one of 
the most multicultural cities in the Northern Realms. WAndering insectodois, brutal minotaurs, wild Xaeens,
mystery Nexans and of course humans - all are welcomed here.
While more cililisated people occupy "stone" part of the city, Xaeens prefer to live near harbor or even behind 
city walls. Xaeens are mainly tolerated for their´s magic and curing abilities (amulets / necklaces)
 which are often used and traded.
Nothampton is beeing ruled by Prince Theron I. -
Age of 30, ruling this city for 6 years. For Prince Theron is every day in this city like new challenge.
Lots of of minor fights and discussions among citiziens.
He is know that he do not love Xaeens to much, but aside of that, he has true "ruling" abilities and he 
is quite good and smart guy.
His personal patrol (about 20 soldiers) is well know in the city. Called themself Jaguars. Their are 
honored and almost worshipped among some Xaeens (it was actually smart Prince´s idea to call themself like
that).
