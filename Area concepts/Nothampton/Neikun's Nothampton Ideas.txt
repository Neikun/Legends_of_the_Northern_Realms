Nothampton is the center of the Theraenian Empire. Here you can find all manners of wonderous landmarks. Such as, Great Castle Dugnar, home to King Konrak II the Wise and the Dugnar royal line. 
The castle was built on top of a crumbling ruin of House Abbrarch when it's rule fell apart, though that was long ago, and only great sages and tomes from the Great Library still know of that history.
