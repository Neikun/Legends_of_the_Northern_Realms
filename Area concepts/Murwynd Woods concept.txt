Arkos:
even though one of the pictures isn't very dark, this area is continually darker than most woods because of the leftovers of darkness from Uttermost which
continually drifts in this direction. Creatures from the darkest places of the DearthFang Ridges are attracted to darkness, they thrive in these woods.

Before Uttermost became dark, these woods were home to a very peaceful people, know one seems to know what happened to them
