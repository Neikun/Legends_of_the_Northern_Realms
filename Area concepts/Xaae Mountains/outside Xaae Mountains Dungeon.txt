That picture with the bridge, the mountains between the Xaae Jungle and the Serpent River.  I have an outside dungeon concept for crossing those mountains that includes these rope bridges, 
mud slides and a nasty maze of exposed treachourous trails to get over

These mountains are like  Zhangjiajie (Avatar) China National Park
