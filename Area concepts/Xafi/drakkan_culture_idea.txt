Xafi Desert
Deadly and mysterious place for many mortals. Usually not involved in any northern realms history.

Ruled by King Anghmar - minotaur wizard. His strenght is legendary, so is his magic. It is said, that he
gained his magical powers from some ancient Artifact, hidden in desert. According to this legend, he defeated
Old desert Dragon and robbed his lair. From treasure he build whole Sanchi city and everything.
But thats just legend. Anghmar is now old and he is trying to figure out something about Xafi desert history.
He has also some nice collection of Desert maps. But he is too old to go search treasures himself. Perhaps if
some high-leveled party will come in future ?... who knows


Geography

Sanchi - for now capitol city. Not too old. Many new temples etc...
Vaeey - old "ruined" city. Some ancient culture lived here. People which were before minotaurs.
Now ocupied by lonely minotaurs, escaped prisoners or any other creatures, which could survive desert climax.

Overall Xafi desert is mysterious country. YOu nver know if you will return, when entering desert. Lots
of ruins and lost cities under. Anything could happen here.
