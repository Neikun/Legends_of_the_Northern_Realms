I could not find a single picture that really spoke of Uttermost to me,
so I found different pictures that embodied different aspects.(note
obviously the broken town picture was not drawn by me)

I will be reffering to the names of the pictures.

-Building shows something I would like the houses to resemble

-broken_town embodies the feel well

-abandoned_town shows an ascencion up a hill and also shows
a nice desolate town.

-ugly_town has great hellish depressing atmosphere

Of course Uttermost will have people.
