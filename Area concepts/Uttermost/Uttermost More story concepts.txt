[1:52:31 AM] Seth Borga: Just an update on git. I added my idea of a story for Uttermost.
I have been putting a lot of thought into that town.
[1:56:30 AM] Arkos: my laptop isn't recognizing the file for Uttermost story
[1:57:19 AM] Arkos: ok, I was able to open it with notepad++
[2:03:33 AM] Arkos: so the settlers are trapped in Uttermost?
[2:04:29 AM] Seth Borga: Yes, no one can leave Uttermost.
[2:04:45 AM] Seth Borga: They are being punished for their crime.
[2:05:51 AM] Seth Borga: For all of time.
With time they have becomme determined to make it a punishment for the ones imprisoning them too though.
[2:07:33 AM] Seth Borga: The story is in part supposed to demonstrate their attitude toward this. Cold and analytical(such as toward the consuming of the minotaurs). Yet also filled with pain and longing for the world they once had.
[2:08:19 AM] Seth Borga: They are likely very egotistical and feel neither regret nor that this was their fault.
[2:09:38 AM] Arkos: so are the spirits who did not get pacified are using the machine to create darkness?
[2:13:11 AM] Seth Borga: Yes somehow the spirits and the lost goromorgs are tied together.(perhaps the crypts are goromorg crypts.) So the machine performs the spirits will. It really was a climate machine to some degree once. Now it does three things.
1. It somehow helps the spirits keep them there.
2.It keeps it colder than any natural winter.
3. It keeps it eternal night.
[2:16:08 AM] Arkos: I like it!  This may fit into something I was thinking about south east of Uttermost, 
maybe left over darkness naturally drifts to the south east, so it goes into murwynd woods  and east of there, 
which causes this affect... one sec... getting the picture...

[2:17:38 AM] Arkos: causes it to be lifeless in that area, not as dark as what you are saying about Uttermost though
[2:18:55 AM] Arkos: and this for Murwynd woods

[2:19:21 AM] Seth Borga: Yeah, I could see the darkness affecting other areas.
I don't think they care who or what else suffers as long as they get revenge on the settler of Uttermost.
[2:21:54 AM] Arkos: as you start going into the endless tundra you see the darkness dissipate like this picture

[2:22:33 AM] Arkos: another idea I have for you with the darkness... one sec
[2:23:36 AM | Edited 2:23:45 AM] Arkos: is dark creatures of the darkest places around the Northern Realms are attracted to Uttermost, they love it there
[2:24:19 AM] Seth Borga: Naturally, it will only make the settlers lives worse.
[2:24:43 AM] Arkos: boy sounds like a fun place to visit!
[2:25:29 AM] Arkos: sounds awesome I really like this :)
[2:26:00 AM] Seth Borga: Thanks, I've spent a lot of time thinking about it.
[2:26:23 AM] Arkos: one sec I would like to show you something I just had an idea for about this...
[2:28:58 AM] Arkos: ok, on the Kalevala side of the darkness, from their point of view, the darkness appears like a wall cloud to the east

[2:30:39 AM] Arkos: now that is ominous
[2:30:52 AM] Seth Borga: Yes I would say that is a pretty good view of it from the outside.
Maybe we should see if something like that last one could be in a cinematic.
(If we could get those mid dungeon)
[2:32:59 AM] Arkos: that would be a sweet cinematic to help describe your story, it would be cool to have that in an outside environment approaching Uttermost as well
[2:34:07 AM] Arkos: so, one last question before I head off to bed, do you have ideas for across the way in Grotto?
[2:36:04 AM] Seth Borga: Hmm, I haven't made much progress there yet.
I have mostly put dungeon thinking off till we have more of both the mechanic and story down.
[2:37:27 AM] Arkos: Well, from your story sounds like theres a ton of stuff just for Uttermost and the crypts
