This is  Saint Catherine’s Monastery in Egypt is the world’s oldest continuously used library.  Looks like a cool concept for Sanchi

Take a look at this link for pictures of it:

the library of the area contains ancient manuscripts and icons and is considered to be the second in its size after Vatican’s library.
Saint Catherine's Monastery lies on the Sinai Peninsula, at the mouth of a gorge at the foot of Mount Sinai in Saint Catherine/Katherine city in Egypt.
On the LotNR map, Sanchi is next to some mountains so it seemed appropriate.
