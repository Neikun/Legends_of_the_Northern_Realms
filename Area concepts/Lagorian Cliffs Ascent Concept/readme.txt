Diarmuid's castle gave me an idea. A dungeon that travels up some cliffs because it is the only route to cross them for miles.  
It would be a mix of outside like the castle bridges/stairs and some inside areas that also travel up.  
Here is a rough concept with green being entrances back and out of the cliffs - I call it the Lagorian Cliffs concept

The same type of dungeon would be used for getting through the Xaae Mountains between the Serpent River and the Xaae Jungle (asian looking picture)


The cliffs could lead to many areas but one of them could be a dungeon deep in the mountains like the 2nd and 3rd pictures
