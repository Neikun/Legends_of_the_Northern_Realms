1. Overview


2. Geography

	2.1. Physical geography and climate


	2.2. Major settlements

		2.2.1. Ilora (name by Drakkan) – main religion and scholastic centre, located between woodlands and mountains.

		2.2.2. (Name pending) – main agriculture centre, located to the north of woodlands.
		A city known for its breath-taking gardens, surrounded by numerous olive grooves, vineyards, wheat fields, fig orchards. Famous for its huge, multilevelled granaries, which are considered one of the Seven World Wondrous Buildings. A rival city of Ilara - it's rarely a military rivalry though. Mostly it's economic struggle for political dominance.

		2.2.3. (Name pending) – northern port
		Usually allied with 2.2.2. Main centre of sea trade with Kingdom of Therean and Malaniam Empire. Exporting vines, oil and copper. Importing furs, wax and iron. A clever merchant may easily gain a fortune here. Unlucky traveller may lose fortune as easily in various Temples of Love or temples of Fortune.

		2.2.4. (Name pending) – southern port
U		sually allied with Ilora. Smaller then 2.2.3. Main centre of sea trade with distant lands like Xaae, Xafi and Hardabar. Lots of exotic goods, rare spices and mysterious artefacts may be found on its bazaars.

	2.3. Other settlements
		Copper mines

	2.4. Small Islands

		2.4.1. Western Island (Name pending)
		There are few things that citizens of all four major cities of Nex would agree on, but the inhabitants of (name pending) are one of those. Considered weird and queer those people worship numerous spirits of creeks and trees. Instead of numerous temples the island is known for sacred grooves. Just like the folks of Isle of Nex, they live in matriarch society and are governed by priests. Actually the only reason the island haven't been conquered yet is because there's absolutely nothing valuable there and potential conquest simply doesn't pay off. The inhabitants of (name pending) pose no thread to other lands, as virtually there are no fighters nor powerful mages amongst them. Also known as sheep folks, habitants of (name pending) have numerous sheep flocks and trades wool for what few goods they need.

		2.4.2. Eastern Island (Name pending)
		Know as Island of the Oracle. Rocky and inhospitable piece of land with scarce plantlike. Surrounded by treacherous underwater rocks and capricious weather it's a place avoided by any prudent sailors. In the centre of the Island, on the high peak the lonely temple have been build in forgotten era by unknown civilisation. Nowadays it is a site of the Oracle, a mysterious priestess, revered and feared by all Nexians, fierce female-warrior and simple peasant alike. A small group of priests (unusually to Nex, these are all males) resides in the temple and are more then willing to take care of treasures and gold provided by those seeking oracle's advice.


3.  Society and religion
People of Isle of Nex form matriarch society with theocracy government. Women are dominant in both priesthood and army thus all power (both political and military) is in their hands. Man is allowed to train warfare and serve as lowly footman and some temples are open for man to become low rank priests, but generally all offices that provide significant power are exclusive for women. Crafts that require more advanced technology are practiced almost exclusively by women as well, such as weaponsmithing. In other professions situation looks much more similar to that meet in mainland. For example the vast majority of sailors or woodworkers are male, just like in other parts of known world.

Isle of Next is famous for its temples and priests (or rather priestess), but it's worth mentioning that religion is so dominant and present in every area of life, that the Nexian term for “temple” may be as well translated as “public building”. For example what would be called library in other lands is called Temple of Knowledge here, and librarians duty is carried by dedicated order of priestess. Many of Nexian finest weapons are likewise crafted by dedicated priestess in Temple of Fiery Goddess, while actually it may be just as well considered a regular foundry. Less noble public buildings are often considered temples as well, for example Temple of Love or Temple of Fortune, which would be otherwise called brothel and gamble den. Nexians just see a hand of gods in every aspect of their everyday life: from knowledge and technology up to gambling and prostitution. Of course difference is not just in name. Nexians really treat everyday activities with sort of divinely solemnity.

	3.2. Army and weaponry
	Nexian military force is equally famous for its axe wielding female-warriors as for its superior naval proficiency. Because of many fine crafters and weaponsmiths, Isle of Nex is a place one can find one of the best weapons, which are usually not only efficient but also remarkable for their beauty. Four weapon types are worth mentioning here. These are:
	- Long axes of Nex - a double blade axes with long handle, only slightly shorter then typical pole arm. It masterfully combines the reach and power of halberd with speed and versatility of battle axe.
	- Scimitars, known as swords of Nex – well balanced and sharp blades favoured for its speed.
	- Javelins. A favoured ranged weapons of Nexian warriors. This versatile weapon is equally efficient whether one is fighting in the open field, defending city walls or during boarding enemy ship.
	- Nexian short bows. Those composite bows, made of antelope's horns and tendons of mountain lions, are surprisingly deadly and powerful for their sizes.

	3.3. Non-humans on Nex

		3.3.1. Minotaurs
		There's relatively numerous population of minotaurs on Isle of Nex. It is almost entirely split between four major cities of Nex, with most of minotaurs living either in 2.2.3. or in 2.2.4. As in all Northern Realms, minotaurs make their living with shear power of their muscle – many of them work in harbours, warehouses or quarries.

		Contrary to minotaurs outside of Nex, few serve as mercenaries since Nex army is heavily based on naval forces and sea  transport of military troops is a vital factor in every campaign. And when every bit of space under your deck counts, you'd rather keep food supplies at bare minimum. That's why every general of Nex have to decide whether he rather keep hungry minotaur on board or simply give up an entire idea of having minotaur mercenaries. Most are prudent enough to chose latter solution.

		There's also significant number of entertainers throughout minotaurs' population on Nex. Most specialise in wrestling or pit fighting, and arenas of Nex are famous (or rather infamous) for it's  extremely bloody yet entertaining gladiator fights. Many of pit fighters are mere slaves or prisoners, but some get renown, becomes real idols of people and sports relatively comfortable lives. Other minotaurs entertainers, one may encounter on Isle of Nex, are various athletes or hammer throwers

		3.3.2. Lizarmen
		Few lizardman calls Isle of Nex home. Some lives in port cities like 2.2.3. or 2.2.4. or work as mercenaries on Nexian ships but they have no impact on everyday live of islanders, not to mention Nexian culture, politics or economy. Outside of major settlements they are generally distrusted and frown upon.

		3.3.3. Insectoid
		Even though there are no native insectoids on Isle of Nex, a decent number of those strange and mysterious folks may be spotted in Ilora because, as all places of knowledge and study, this city of hundret temples lures insectoids scholars and mages. Even if commoners may be suspicious to insectoids, most priests value their presence for rare tomes, exotic herbs or never-seen-before minerals they offer as a payment for a chance to study in one of numerous temples of Nex. More sagacious priests are also aware that wisdom brought by an insectoid sage is far more valuable then any given plant, stone or book. That's why they are usually willing to accept insectoid in their temple for temporary service as advisor or teacher.
