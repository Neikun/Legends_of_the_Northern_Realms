Obviously we can't recreate these, but the purpose of these pictures is to help us get in LotNR visually to help spark ideas for:

wallsets, stories, creatures, deity, assets, etc.

The reason there are some folders specifically for some areas is because I have felt that a particular picture is fitting for that area or city
please feel free to do the same.  There are some generic folders with cool pics that have not been specifically assigned to a city or
an area.  If you feel a pic is fitting for something, create a folder and move the pic to that area.
Please leave comments about any ideas you may have from these pictures.
