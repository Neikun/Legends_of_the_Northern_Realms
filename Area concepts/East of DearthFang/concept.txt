Arkos:
this area is continually dark and a wasteland because of the leftovers of darkness from Uttermost which
continually drifts in this direction. Also, previously this area is high desert, being a rain shadow
because the DearthFang Ridges suck up all the rain and most of it goes back to the west slope
