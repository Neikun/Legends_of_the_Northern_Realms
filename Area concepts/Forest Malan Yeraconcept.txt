Arkos:
These woods have some of largest trees in the known world.  The reason for there size is
because the weather continually comes in from the west and the storms slam into 
some of the highest mountains to the east right next to the forest.  Many rivers, waters, etc.
flow from the west slope into the forest.  This is one of the rainiest areas in the Northern Realms
Think Twilight city Forks on the olympic penisuala in Washington State or Red Wood Forest
Because the florest floor is mostly water and waterfalls, people have built their settlements
in the trees with an amazing network of bridges from tree to tree
