Rough Draft:

After reading some of the suggestions...
I really liked McSkivv's idea about starting with a single character.
This sparked idea of a non-linear party progression. Being able to choose
different characters based on various decisions and actions would be very
immersive. Also having the possiblity for characters to die in the story line
might be worth looking into for added party/player connection.

[Replayability]
This is usually the make or break of buying a game for me. I love games like Morrowind
and Skyrim that allow for virtually infinite posiibilities on each time through. I propose
that we implement random and procedural generation of content whenever it is expedient to and
aligns with the mod creation goals.

[Shops]
What about expanding on Asteroth's idea of upgradeable armor by adding shops and even inns.
We could create a GUI for those kinds of interactions. Even give a bonus to rest when in an inn
and disallow monster attacks when resting there.


[Monsters]
I think it would really cool if there were monsters about which players were genuinely concerned.
Exp and/or level stealing monsters would be something from which anyone might run.

[Items]
I think having a stash like in Diablo II/Torchlight Path of Exile would be most awesome.
Have it located in a town or towns and let the player access it while in town but not in dungeons.

Also, a portal scroll or spell (limited) to get back to town would be cool!

[Travel]
A travel service would also be good for navigating the world.
