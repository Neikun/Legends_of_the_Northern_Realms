Widgets:
I think that widgets would make creating dialogs much easier than without.
The parts I would need to get started are buttons, backgrounds and transports
controls (vertical and horizonatal scrollbar background, scrollers etc.)
All images would idealy be named according to their function and have a sister image
that was slightly different with the name having "_hover" tacked onto the end of it.

Widget types I'll be testing.
Listbox object
Dropdown Combobox object
Paragraph object
Button object
Image object

If these basic widgets will work, then any and all others should follow quite simply.
The GUI framework will be under construction soon and I'll have classes and objects
as the intial focus.
