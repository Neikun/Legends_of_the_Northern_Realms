I've now made Chitin Gloves for us. It is part of the Chitin set and 
has the same relative stats to the other pieces and the Gauntlets of Valor do to its set.

For example:

Cuirass of Valor armor = 15
Gauntlets of Valor armor = 15

Chitin Cuirass armor = 9
Chitin Gloves armor = 9

The weight now corrosponds to the Valor Set. Komag pointed out that all chitin items weight a little over 50% of valor 
items, so these gloves now have a weight of 1.5 kg to Valor Gauntlets being 2.5 kg.
