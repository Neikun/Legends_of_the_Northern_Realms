I've now made Chitin Gloves for us. It is part of the Chitin set and 
has the same relative stats to the other pieces and the Gauntlets of Valor do to its set.

For example:

Cuirass of Valor armor = 15
Gauntlets of Valor armor = 15

Chitin Cuirass armor = 9
Chitin Gloves armor = 9

It does require light armor and has had it's weight set to 3, which is up from .5 kg for leather gloves.
