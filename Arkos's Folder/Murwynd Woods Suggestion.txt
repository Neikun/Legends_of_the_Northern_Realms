[8:44:57 AM] Arkos: please bare with me as I can't spell:  A powerful sorceror conjerured up the dead from a coffin deep under the castle, the dead person used to be a powerful knight, 
he challenged all of the knights to the death, but no one could kill him with a regular sword.  Merlin (the good mage) had an incredible sword which he took to a powerful mystical 
magical dragon to continue the forging of the sword.  After the dragon breathed fire on it, the new sword had awesome gold markings and other cool stuff, the dragon said that 
sword was very powerful it could kill the dead knight but would be too powerful in the wrong hands.  After the undead knight was killed by the magical dragon sword, 
the dragon told Merlin to hide the sword from any mortal person.  Merlin through it into a lake.

[8:46:47 AM] Arkos: We might be able to play off of this.  Whether the most powerful sworld is in the middle of the great lake 
and a quest to get it after reading stuff about what happened in the royal library, or having to find the cave in the dearfang ridges 
to find the dragon to have it breath on a sword in order to kill the Great Dark Lord Murwynd in the Murwynd Woods

[8:48:26 AM] Neikun: I'd rather not totally copy a story lol 
But certain elements could probably be duplicated an expanded and flipped around

[8:53:59 AM] Arkos: Maybe some rumors, that know one has made it out of Murwynd woods alive after the Dark Lord settled there.  
There is something there that we need there from before his presence, so we have to figure out what we need to kill the powerful keeper of the forest.  
If you enter that forest whithout the right stuff you just get your butt kicked

[8:54:58 AM] Neikun: Hold onto this idea n.n

[9:01:20 AM] Arkos: ok, maybe we don't tell the player quite yet they will get their butts kicked no matter what level they are until they go there 
and get their butts kicked.  When they turn around they might run into some old hermit on the outside of the woods that tells them more information 
on what they need and quest to go on in order to kill the dark lord Murwyn
