Every contributor is to have their own designated folder in the github to house their assets, suggestions, anything made specifically for this project.
Example:
In Skuggasveinn's folder you would find Skuggasveinn's Suggestions.txt as well as a models folder and textures folder.

For dungeon designers each designer will need to make their own set of .luas and have them imported in the init.lua
Example: 
Mcskivv would have
mcskivv_materials.lua
mcskivv_objects.lua
mcskivv_items.lua
mcskivv_sounds.lua
mc_skivv_monsters.lua
ect. ect.

This way anything you need to edit for personal use is right there for you.
If an asset is desired by more than one designer, and will be used in exaclty the same way, it will be moved to something like
global_materials.lua
