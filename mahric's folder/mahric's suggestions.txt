Starting Area Proposition
=========================
After looking at the proposal from Arkos and McSkivv I tend to lean towards Arkos' suggestion.
Mainly because it also has a snowy/cold part, which we have wonderfull assets for. It would be a shame not to use those.
There's also talk about hermits and witches of the north, which better fit in the northen part of the map (see below).

Is anything decided on this already?


Lore
====
I took a quick look at lore I could extract from the "item"-assets file and came up with the following things:

 - "Priestesess of Nex": A bunch of priests that forged the "Sword of Nex", a weapon with incomparable sharpness
 - "Tirin": The name (of the leader?) of the cult of Tirin. The tribe has an initiation rite that yields a "Bracelet of Tirin" for everyone who passes it
 - "Hermits of Basabua": It is unclear what Basabua is (a town? goddess? name of the leader?), but these hermits write books about their way of life (tome of health)
 - "Keepers of the sunken library": No reference to where it is, but this can be used to incorporate the "flooded dungeon" assets that are already produced
 - "Master Chef of Nothampton Palace": Is looking for grim caps to use in his finest soups. So there is a palace and a chef, but his name is not told in the lore
 - "Witches of the north": Use blooddrop blossom in dark rituals. One sentence, enough for a whole dungeon :)


Questions:
==========
Basic questions that need to be answered before we fully start on making dungeons:

 - Who are we making this mod for? Casual players, dungeon crawling experts, ...?
   Making a dungeon for either group could result in severely different dungeons, possibly not liked by the other group.
   Dungeons for casual players would contain more clues, less puzzles where you need that item you should have taken from the first floor etc.
   Thinking about the amount of effort we're going to put in this whole project I suggest we aim for the casual player, to reach te largest possible audience.
   (we could always include some 'hardcode' dungeons for the pro's, but this question is about the main audience).


Requests for Almost Human:
==========================

From Neikun:
  - AI State:friendly (for npc's)

Additional requests:
  - Please give us a way to save a game on demand (so we can save when you enter an inn, or before a hard part of the dungeon comes up). (to prevent abuse maybe only overwriting a quicksave)
  - Please include the background of an empty character screen (either equipment, exp or skills, background is all the smae) so we can seemlessly blend in our extensions
