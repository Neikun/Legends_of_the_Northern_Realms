When in conversation the player has the ability to turn. This isn't terrible.
The player can however attack/throw things during conversation. This is bad.
I love that you were able to make the ogre turn hostile on hit though.

Good idea for clicking the screen to speed up the dialog up.
You may want to increase the default type speed even slightly.

Fast travel is looking amazing. You may want to have a gui pop up in the square before the map shows up where the player can anser yes or now:
"Are you sure you'd like to travel to Uttermost?"

Also, because the party can turn, it is possible to turn and cast fireburst at the wall and damage the party.

Controls feedback: I don't think general controls will be needed as they can be accessed via the main menu.
The music selector would be cool but likely not needed for this mod.

Awesome stuff. Can't get over that fast travel system.
