I had no idea this (map travel) was already under construction!

Very cool, and most importantly: it seems to work like a charm. Had I checked the material we had thoroughly before posting my inferior suggestion yesterday, I could have saved a lot of work. :P

I have no complaints, but a couple inquiries about the future:
-How will we include exploration? Should new map locations unlock with conversation and perhaps studying maps and books? I rather like the idea of secret locations or even dungeons, but I don't like manic "cleaning" for secrets everywhere I go.
-How should food consumption work with traveling? I think food as a "fuel" for travel could work, but that'd mean there would have to be a renewing source of food everywhere travelable. On the other hand, could seem strange if it had no effect at all (or perhaps the party hunts on the way or something?)

I might be ahead of our time asking these now, but that's what popped up in my mind.

Dialogue is rather convincing too, no bugs to add from me. The text scroll is a cool addition, and with the skipping button it works rather fine too.
