Absolutely beautiful.  The dialogue system should be excellent, though, you might have a problem with variating resolutions.  The fast travel system is awesome, but it needs two things:
1. a little musical diddy that plays in the background.  Something that screams "adventure is out there!" while being relatively subtle so as to avoid being an annoyance.
2. a way to skip the whole animation.  I.E. press space to move on with your life
