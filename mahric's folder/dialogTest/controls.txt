--- v0.2 ---------------------------------------------------------

 - Travel looks better (centered in screen with hudPrints tell you from and to where you're traveling)
 - You can travel from the Grotto to Uttermost and back as many times as you like (though you'd probably be dead before you reach the 400,000,000 times)
 - Cleaned up the source, it's kind of cleanish now
 - Source adjusted to easily add new POIs in the source


@Arkos:
I'm glad you like it, I like your concept of making trips longer while staying on one map.
We'd have to see how many "lanes" we'll put between two towns though, because walking 270 spaces is getting boring fast. If we keep it down to like maybe 5 or 6 lanes, we also have more room to have a wider look. That IS something i'm worried about with that proposal: if i'm travelling over a grassy field, how to stop me going from lane 0 to lane 1, while still keeping the feeling of the grassy field? That might be easier when we have lanes of 8 high. (Just trying to think along)

And starting a dialog can be done with anything that we program. At this moment you can start it by conventional scripting and just clicking on an npc, but Centauri Soldier was talking about expanding his NPC framework to make it possible that an NPC might even notice the party and start a conversation on it's own. Technically a lot is possible, just let us know what you want.


--- v0.1 ---------------------------------------------------------

Warning: This is just a proof of concept!

The pictures are printscreens from some custom 2d dialog fiddling in Grimrock.
These controls do not react on user input. We still need to script that.

If you want to see for yourself:
 - Start the mod dialogTest.dat 
 - Walk through the teleporter
 - Stand on any of the pressureplates for a dialog to show
 - Step off the pressure plate to get rid of the dialog
 - Pressing the button will toggle between normal and "mouse hovers over control" layout

Any and all remarks are welcome, but please put them in this document!


Arkos:
Great work! Your teleporter sparked an idea on how to save space in one level for traveling outside. I have an 
example of how it might work in my folder. I was talking with Neikun, I'm hoping we can have at least
one outside level between major towns, dungeons etc. Your map opening up is great!  I was thinking we 
may need a map like that when we are outside traveling to bring up like the dungeon map. 
With your dialog test, is it possible to bring up dialog by just standing next to a npc or standing on a hidden pressure plate?
The button on the wall affecting dialog example could also work when touching an item on a table in a store in a town?
Good stuff!
