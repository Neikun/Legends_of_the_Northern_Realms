Warning: This is just a proof of concept!

The pictures are printscreens from some custom 2d dialog fiddling in Grimrock.
These controls do not react on user input. We still need to script that.

If you want to see for yourself:
 - Start the mod dialogTest.dat 
 - Walk through the teleporter
 - Stand on any of the pressureplates for a dialog to show
 - Step off the pressure plate to get rid of the dialog
 - Pressing the button will toggle between normal and "mouse hovers over control" layout

Any and all remarks are welcome, but please put them in this document!
