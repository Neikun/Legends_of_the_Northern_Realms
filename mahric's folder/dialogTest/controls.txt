Warning: This is just a proof of concept!

The pictures are printscreens from some custom 2d dialog fiddling in Grimrock.
These controls do not react on user input. We still need to script that.

If you want to see for yourself:
 - Start the mod dialogTest.dat 
 - Walk through the teleporter
 - Stand on any of the pressureplates for a dialog to show
 - Step off the pressure plate to get rid of the dialog
 - Pressing the button will toggle between normal and "mouse hovers over control" layout

Any and all remarks are welcome, but please put them in this document!


Arkos:
Great work! Your teleporter sparked an idea on how to save space in one level for traveling outside. I have an 
example of how it might work in my folder. I was talking with Neikun, I'm hoping we can have at least
one outside level between major towns, dungeons etc. Your map opening up is great!  I was thinking we 
may need a map like that when we are outside traveling to bring up like the dungeon map. 
With your dialog test, is it possible to bring up dialog by just standing next to a npc or standing on a hidden pressure plate?
The button on the wall affecting dialog example could also work when touching an item on a table in a store in a town?
Good stuff!
