Ok!

This is a simple mockup of the map idea I was formulating.

Meaning we'd make a GUI "app" for it in-game, so that players could move around the map as a sprite or some other indicator, and towns and points of interest (examples of both enclosed in the picture) could be seen and visited through a simple and intuitive user interface. You could also see in which towns you have active quests (the "!" in the map).

The text could also appear when you come near it's "beacon", perhaps excluding major cities.

The weird symbol with the boxes is supposed to represent the party in this picture, I couldn't think of a better symbol so that will have to do. The texts in italic indicate explanations for the symbols, this could be a quest name or a tag for a point of interest to explore. On the lower edge is a simple tooltip, telling what to press to enter a place (or anything else, really, if necessary). The upper corner shows the current region/kingdom the party is in.

I presume this would be a light, but reasonably classy looking alternative. It still does not exclude the possibility of random encounters, hidden places and dungeons etc.

Finally, the picture is indeed a MOCKUP. I'm not saying we should use the official map as the background, indeed if we use a zoomed up display we would need to draw more detailed maps ourselves, or give up maps and just draw the terrain itself from a birds' eye view. I also don't mean the mechanics would be just as presented, it is a simple example of what I was thinking.

Tell me what you think!
