We should be able to fast travel to locations we've already been to from a specific location.

Some fast travelling instances should be interupted by various things. "i.e. Caravan robbers"


Drakkans comment: I already played the "fast travel" dungeon and it is looking really cool. Not sure how you want manage that 
player could choose where he want to fast travel, but thats probably only scripting problem. Interrupted things - why not, it is
causual stuff in game like these :)
some tips for instances:
- caravan with rare goods
- traveling NPC which coul join party based on some conversation
- some unique dungeon just for exp and some items
- bandits of course (animals, humans...)
