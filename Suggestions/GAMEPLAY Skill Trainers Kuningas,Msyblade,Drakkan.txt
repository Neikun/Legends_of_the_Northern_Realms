 msyblade: More protection, but weaker attack. Then the player could make a "Tank" fighter, or a Damage dealing fighter with less protection depending on the curses they "Choose" Almost like New Sub-Classes!

Kuningas: Another way for that (more customization) could be skill trainers in towns and maybe even dungeons. 
But I'm not sure about the mechanical side

drakkkan: trainers I like. if we will have some curency I think raising some points for gold is always fine

msyblade: Ooooooh, raise a skill with hard earned cash/treasure, or remove curse

drakkkan: mechanical side = very easy. you can just buy tomes of... from trainers :)

Kuningas: That in it's simplest.
 And maybe a few secret skills only available in certain dungeons.

msyblade: I LIKE it

 Kuningas: Not necessarily more powerful, just more specialized
