	Contar Stoneskull is likely from Kaelava or further east. Maybe even Uttermost. 
Some members of the base party should be dead. Two should have barely survived.
Here is my events between the end of Legend of Grimrock and the start of Legends of the Northern Realms:

	Mork died in the explosion. Pushing the others out of the way of a massive flying debris was his last act. 
Contar Stoneskull died of his wounds while his wife, Yennica lay unconscious at the rim of the crater. 
Sancsaron, though badly bruised, stayed conscious through the whole ordeal. He couldn't help Contar. All of the flasks of potion were shattered by the explosion and his medicinal herbs were all used up. Despite Sancsaron's uncaring nature, he did his best not to let him suffer. Something about his time in Mount Grimrock chained to this man had formed some kind of bond. He was sad to see Contar die.

	Sansaron now had Zhandul's Orb, his life's pursuit. He was determined to keep it safe.
Shortly after Yennica awoke and they began to talk about what to do next, the kings men found them while investigating the explosion. They were taken to Castle Theraen to meet with the king and his magister, Alrast. Contar's body was taken with them too, but Mork's has never been found.
	They were treated as guests rather than prisoners, and so were able to keep their possesions. Regardless of this, they were searched anyway. Sancsaron was able to keep them from seeing Zhandul's Orb with a handy invisibilty charm he had learned in the mountain.
At present, King Konrak II the Wise and his Grace's Magister Alrast are being told the events that unfolded in Grimrock Mountain. The king watches them tell their tale with a look of disbelief, but the Magister's eyes go wide with every detail as he recalls words from ancient texts he had not perused for many decades.
