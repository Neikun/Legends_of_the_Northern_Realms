Starting party
one character. one or two more should join shortly after begining. At the end player shoudl have choice lets say max from 10 char
there should be some "weaker" characters which are able to join party at the begining and player is able to train them and few
strong chars which will offer joining party later in game.

Also some characters which will join party just for some time (to do particular quest etc..) is very fine option - this way
player will ahve still some variations in party, which is cool.

Inns
should be central points where player could hire character which he does not have in party curently.
