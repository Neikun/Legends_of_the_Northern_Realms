Corrg City

Far away from civilization, in the waste rocky mountains full of minotaurs and ogres lies city of Corrg.
It´s an Ogre city. Yes - not all ogres all hostile. 
However do not expect warm welcome parties here. The only race which ogres respect are minotaurs, which are also living in this city.

Corrg is situated in deep canyon, protected by mountains from several sides. These mountains are full of caves, which are often used as "houses"
More respect and hiearchy = larger cave. Some minotaurs are also living in big rough houses.
Unofficial "leader" of city is ogre known as Srg. Big King Srg how he is often called. Apart from the other ogres is is somehow smarter and also
more brutal. He is searching for anything which would help him to gain more strenght and power. Like powerfull artifacts. Often he imprison visitors
and send them to search some.


Economy
Some shops. Paradise for minotaurs. Axes, maces, armors. Also some dwarf staff (if dwarfes ever existed)

Ingame
Mine tilesets retextured to ice should work fine for caves
otherwise north tileset could be used for buildings etc...
