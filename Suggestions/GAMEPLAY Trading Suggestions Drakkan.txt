Ok since I do not saw any suggestions for trade so far, here is my idea

Trade could work in similar way like in Dungeon Master 2 (its quite easy and shoudl be do-able withs some scripts). Standard currency shoud be
coins (copper (2 copper = 1 silver), silver, gold (1 gold = 10 copperor 5 silver etc...). 
Each standard item should have its value defined for sell / buy. Then some other items should be just sellable (some types or gems etc...), or
just buy-able (like torches for example).

When in store, on one wall is "window" with picutre of item you want buy or sell (see attached picture named trade table.jpg). This picture could be 
scrollable for next item(s) by pushing arrows on the side of this window (arrows should be encrypted buttons).
When you want buy some item, you need just put money somewhere (in case you are selling, put there item)  and confirm by pushing another button
or talking to trader or something... 
If item you are selling is matching what is on the picture, you get money. If you buying and you insert enough money, you will get your item.
Some items should be unique (should dissapear from the option after buying)
Trader should accept all money (for example if item cost 1G, it should accept also 5S). Or even if you insert more, it should return additional money back

just idea. what you think ?



pric list (C = 1copp, S = silver G = gold)

Item name	buy value	sell value
Torch		1C		none
Flask		1S		1C
Cudgel		1S		1C
Blue gem	1Z		5C
etc...
