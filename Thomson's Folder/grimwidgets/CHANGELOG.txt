v0.2
(Thomson)   - gw_events rewritten. State is now a string. Action definition is now much cleaner. There is
	      no need to define callbacks for each state. Events can be aborted (closed for now and restarted
	      when party revisits event location). Events now use textured windows.
(JKos)	    - gw_book example added. It features a generic book with text, chapters, images, headers and columns.
(Thomson)   - Integrated Dialog module from Legends of the Northern Realms
	      by Mahric. It it still not very clean, but usable. The new textured windows
	      look simply beautiful.

v0.01
(JKos)		- Added gw_element.onDraw hook. If the hook returns false the element won't be drawn.
		- Bug fix: margins didn't not work correctly with position after and below,element_id
		- Added new relative positions: after_previous and below_previous. Element will be placed automatically after or below the previously added sibling.
				example: elem:setRelativePosition('below_previous')
(JKos)		- Added gw_text (just a plain text without any parent element)
		- Added gw_element:getAncestor() which returns the 1st parent of the element in hierarchy or self if parent is not defined
		- Added gw_element:deactivate(),gw_element:activate() methods and gw_element.active property
			so it's now possible to close the parent gui element by calling self:getAncestor():deactivate() 
		- Added gw.setDefaultColor(color) and gw.setDefaultTextColor(color) which can be used to set the default pen color when drawing widgets and text
		- Added gw_element.textColor property which defines the color of text inside of the element

			- Updated compass images to those created by Germanny (thanks!)
(JKos)		- Added spell_book script entity for developement purposes
