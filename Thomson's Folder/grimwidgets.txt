This is a copy of grimwidgets, that I'm working on together
with JKos and Xanathar. I plan to update this copy occasionally,
but the most up to date version is here:

https://github.com/xanathar/grimwidgets

Useful things in the repo:

1. All-purpose book (can contain text, sections, images, columns, many
   pages, etc.) Just pick it up and right click to see a demo.

2. Various dialog boxes (just press buttons around), every one does
   something different.

3. Events. The idea is to have a a simple way to define scripted events.
Here's simplified code that handles it. It is possible to specify
optional callback that is called when specific action is taken.

This is really a FSM (finite state machine) implementation with well
defined states and transitions between them (actions). There's no limit
how much complex this could get. It is possible to do loops between
states if needed.

states = {

  { "init",   "An injured dwarf lies on the ground before you."},

  { "healed", "Having regained his strength, the dwarf thanks you."},

  { "join",   "Taghor joins your party"},
  { "nojoin", "Taghor thanks again and wanders off"}
}

function onJoin()

   hudPrint("You've got a new dwarf in your party!")
end



actions = {

  { "init",      "healed",   "Tend his wounds"},

  { "init",      "abort",    "Leave" },

  { "healed",    "join",     "Yes" },

  { "healed",    "nojoin",   "No" },

  { "join",      "end",      "Continue", onJoin},

  { "nojoin",    "end",      "Continue"}

}


4. Add new member to your party. If there are less than 4 guys, the new
one joins immediately. If there are 4 already, a GUI dialog is shown asking
who should be left behind.

5. Spellbook. Open skills tab for your mage and you'll see a spellbook with
some spells listed. The list of spells is short, but it shows it may work.

6. On screen compass. Press C to show/hide a compass.

I'd appreciate your comments and suggestions on those scripts.
It is a merge of old grimwidgets code and Dialog code written by Mahric.
It currently uses module loading from LoG framework by JKos, but it is
very similar to what is in LotNR framework. I don't know how other modules
work, so I won't try doing merge between those two frameworks on my own.
Can someone help with this?
