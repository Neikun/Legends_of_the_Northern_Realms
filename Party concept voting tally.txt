We would like to know how the Dev's here have conceptualized the way the player starts in the world. There are two main votes to get us rolling, and neither of them likely have your concepts covered, so please write comments/suggestions at the bottom of this file.


Tally number 1: Single character protaganist, or entire party?

Should the player create one main, central character that the mod kind of centers on, who earns/unlocks party members.
This champion cannot be "Dropped"
Tally Here:


Or Should they create a party of 4, and later add/drop ANY of them at will. (1)
Tally Here: 
Neikun (Should be able to create 1-4 characters, but be restricted from using the base party)




Tally number 2: Should the champions not currently in the party scale xp to the main character, or stagnate if not used.
For instance "I need to go take my new mage for a spin and get him a few skills." If it is scaled. the player could level 4 fighters, then just grab a mage and he's instantly level 14 also. Also, the weak party member that needs "protected" may help make the player feel more vulnerable, which is something we may/may not want.

Non-Active Party members should scale experience to the main party (1)
Tally Here:
Neikun


Non-Active party members will not progress unless the player intentionally progresses them.
Tally Here:
