Now, I understand the principles of democracy, and realize the importance of suppo
rting each other; after all, I\'92m not a socialist. But it stands to point out that when everything went to hell in a hand basket, my first inclination was to absolve myself of the pain associated with 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, and everything else. I didn\'92t l
ike feeling helpless, and yes, even a little guilty, for grand schemes far beyond my control. Epic events, that resulted in thousands of fatalities in my great nation. It wasn\'92t the governments\'92 doing, this guilt I was feeling. It was just a natural inclin
ation bred into me by the generations before. I wanted to do my part, but I couldn\'92t identify my role. When I tried, the only role I fit was \'93victim\'94. That is why I moved to the American Samoa.}

It\'92s snowed every day since I moved here. I always loved the way thick snow falls\tab , obscuring the view of the outside world. I take an extra moment to watch it dance; hoping 
deep down that it would never stop. I see the school bus pull up to the front driveway, and call my little girl downstairs, she\'92s five years old and started kindergarten.\'94 Thank heavens for bus service \'93I think to myself. She grabs her backpack, barks \'93Bye
 dad!\'94, and runs out the door excitedly toward the bus. I can\'92t help but smile to myself\'85\'94My little girl\'94, I say under my breath. I\'92ve got this aloof feeling about me, kind of loosy-goosy you know. It\'92s not unsettling, but it is enough to notice. I head ou
t the door on my way to the hardware store. I don\'92t remember what I have to get there, but no matter; it will come to me later. It really is a beautiful town, there\'92s something about snow lying on every surface that has a uniform aesthetic to it. Pulling u
p to the hardware store, I catch myself wondering if my mom would like it here; and decide she most certainly would. Who wouldn\'92t? I bend over to lean through the car window and fetch my keys from the seat after closing the door. I feel so, so, light. Not 
outright floating, but I just can\'92t get my feet on the ground. It\'92s getting to the point that I am annoyed by it. I {\rtlch\ltrch\dbch\hich\i\loch\i cannot }shake it, no foundation. I pull my upper body out of the window and turn around to see the same elderly Samoan man, standing {\rtlch\ltrch\dbch\hich\i\loch\i right be

is reinforced by her presence. I\'92m not alone in these circumstances anymore; I won\'92t have to wonder if I\'92m going nuts or if things are happening as strange as they seem to be. I wonder why she\'92s here, in deep northern Russia, where I ran to with the intent

onder what she wants to tell me so urgently, and finally ask \'93What is it mom\'94? She looks at me, nodding affirmatively, like I know what she\'92s going to say. I search inside myself to see if there\'92s anything I missed. What is so damned obvious that I complet
