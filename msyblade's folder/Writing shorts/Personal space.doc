\pard\sl480\slmult1\tab Life is funny; when I lived in the states there was always a sense of social responsibility, this ideology that we\rquote re all responsible for the condition of American society. Now, I understand the principles of democracy, and realize the importance of supporting each other; after all, I\rquote m not a socialist. But it stands to point out that when everything went to hell in a hand basket, my first inclination was to absolve myself of the pain associated with 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, and everything else. I didn\rquote t like feeling helpless, and yes, even a little guilty, for grand schemes far beyond my control. Epic events, that resulted in thousands of fatalities in my great nation. It wasn\rquote t the governments\rquote  doing, this guilt I was feeling. It was just a natural inclination bred into me by the generations before. I wanted to do my part, but I couldn\rquote t identify my role. When I tried, the only role I fit was \ldblquote victim\rdblquote . That is why I moved to the American Samoa.\par

\tab The beach is beautiful here, the sky, the horizon\'85Even the rain is pretty. Yeah, I remember why I came here. A fleeting thought passes through me; can I communicate with these people? I\rquote ve lived here for awhile now, how long I can\rquote t remember\'85weeks, possibly months. I haven\rquote t kept track. To be honest, I have this sense of grogginess that I can\rquote t shake. Bah. No matter \'85My daughter runs around the side of the house to join me\'85She\rquote s so beautiful. I never have gotten over the sense of pure love I feel daily when I spot her. I turn around to gaze at my house, bear with me, I just don\rquote t remember what it looks like. The failure of my memory doesn\rquote t bother me, it\rquote s an easy problem to solve; just turn and look at your house. What bothers me is the strange elderly Samoan gentleman standing next to me. Not four feet away, next to me. I didn\rquote t see him approach, and it bothers me. I glance around to find my daughter\'85.Gone inside to eat lunch, I\rquote m sure. I turn my attention back to the old man. \ldblquote Hello.\rdblquote  I say, smiling. He looks at me quizzically, shakes his head, and responds \ldblquote Kaew Pu\rdblquote . Well, so much for communication. I feel a sense of sorrow; I had hoped to be able to communicate freely. I find myself wondering if I\rquote d have an easier time in Northern Russia. FAR northern Russia, where supplies come into town twice a month, where it\rquote s too cold to get to know all of the neighbors. But that\rquote s enough daydreaming, let\rquote s get back to the task at hand.\par

\tab I lean over and open the kitchen window to look outside; snowing again, figures. It\rquote s snowed every day since I moved here. I always loved the way thick snow falls\tab , obscuring the view of the outside world. I take an extra moment to watch it dance; hoping deep down that it would never stop. I see the school bus pull up to the front driveway, and call my little girl downstairs, she\rquote s five years old and started kindergarten.\rdblquote  Thank heavens for bus service \ldblquote I think to myself. She grabs her backpack, barks \ldblquote Bye dad!\rdblquote , and runs out the door excitedly toward the bus. I can\rquote t help but smile to myself\'85\rdblquote My little girl\rdblquote , I say under my breath. I\rquote ve got this aloof feeling about me, kind of loosy-goosy you know. It\rquote s not unsettling, but it is enough to notice. I head out the door on my way to the hardware store. I don\rquote t remember what I have to get there, but no matter; it will come to me later. It really is a beautiful town, there\rquote s something about snow lying on every surface that has a uniform aesthetic to it. Pulling up to the hardware store, I catch myself wondering if my mom would like it here; and decide she most certainly would. Who wouldn\rquote t? I bend over to lean through the car window and fetch my keys from the seat after closing the door. I feel so, so, light. Not outright floating, but I just can\rquote t get my feet on the ground. It\rquote s getting to the point that I am annoyed by it. I \i cannot \i0 shake it, no foundation. I pull my upper body out of the window and turn around to see the same elderly Samoan man, standing \i right behind me. \i0\ldblquote How long have you been standing there?\rdblquote  I ask. He\rquote s just standing there looking at me, as if judging my soul. I feel uneasy, is this man linked to me somehow? How come I don\rquote t recognize any part of him? I\rquote m not angry at him, just confused. I reserve the possibility that he is justified in his actions, maybe he\rquote s trying to help me. Still regarding me solemnly, his expression changes to one of purpose, he needs me to understand something, I can \i feel\i0  it. \ldblquote Kaew Pu\rdblquote  he says. He says it with concern. He says it with compassion. He says it with fear. \par
\par
\pard\fi720\sl480\slmult1 I\rquote m so confused, what does it mean?! Why is this man from somewhere else so concerned with my\'85.my\'85 I don\rquote t even know what he\rquote s concerned with. I need to get my feet on solid ground. I\rquote ve got to collect my thoughts. I can get a grip if I just try.\par
\par
 I don\rquote t how it happened; I don\rquote t know when it happened; but when I look up, the old man is not there next to me, my mom is. I can\rquote t help but get angry. \ldblquote How dare he?\rdblquote  I feel betrayed. He is intentionally playing on my emotions. He has crossed the line. I take a step closer to look in his eyes, determine his intentions if possible. I see warmth, I see caring, I see an understanding that I\rquote ve only seen one place before; it \i is\i0  my mom. She smiles at me and I feel my feet plant solidly in the ground. My psyche is reinforced by her presence. I\rquote m not alone in these circumstances anymore; I won\rquote t have to wonder if I\rquote m going nuts or if things are happening as strange as they seem to be. I wonder why she\rquote s here, in deep northern Russia, where I ran to with the intention of escaping 21\super st\nosupersub  century society? I tell her I love her and give her a big hug, I feel so comforted by her presence. She starts pushing me back before I\rquote m ready to let go, ducks her head under my gaze and regards me for what seems like an eternity. I wonder what she wants to tell me so urgently, and finally ask \ldblquote What is it mom\rdblquote ? She looks at me, nodding affirmatively, like I know what she\rquote s going to say. I search inside myself to see if there\rquote s anything I missed. What is so damned obvious that I completely missed? I look at her expectantly, hoping within hope that answers are forthcoming. She looks at me, holds my gaze to give me one last chance to figure it out on my own, and says \ldblquote Wake up.\rdblquote\par

\pard\sl480\slmult1\tab\b0 I roll over and turn off the alarm. I was having a dream just now dammit, what was it? Fleeting thoughts pass through my mind, never long enough to get a grasp on them. It\rquote s like trying to catch smoke with your fingers, the harder you grasp, the faster it leaves. I turn on the radio for background music and gather my clothes to get ready for the day. A news update comes on and I lean out of the bathroom to see if anything interesting is happening in the world. They inform me that Hurricane Katrina may have resulted in ten thousand fatalities. They inform me that some sick-o in Florida has kidnapped and murdered a little girl my daughters\rquote  age. They inform me that if I stay tuned, they can tell me where the terrorists are going to strike tomorrow. I sigh deeply, step into the bathroom. Sometimes I wish that I could just crawl into my own mind to live, where everything makes sense.\par
