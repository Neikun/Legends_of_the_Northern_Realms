Germanny´s Legend of Grimrock Assets
-- by Germanny (rh.hinne@t-online.de)

This is a floor carpet model with full texturing - 1024x1024px
Included are diffuse, specular, normal map.

I add the UV layout as image, you can easily create a new diffuse map
for some new carpets.
You can leave the normal and diffuse as is!

-----------------------
Usage:
copy the folder 'log_carpets' with all files in your 'mod_assets' folder.
Insert into your init.lua:
import "mod_assets/log_carpets/log_carpets.lua"

Have fun,
Germanny
