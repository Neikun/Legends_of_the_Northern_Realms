Wanting some storyline ideas to start thinking about, So to get the ball rolling. . .


    (This is just off the top of my head, and just to try and get ideas flowing.)


    Your average dungeon crawler fanboy sits at his pc, playing the newest iteration of "Dungeon Emperor", When an electrical storm hits. 
Vortex, warping, confused. . .wakes up in a world that he somewhat recognizes, and is comfortable (and excited!) to be in. "This looks like "Muscle and Mana 3! I love that franchise!" and "Oh my god! the limited edition cufflinks from "Magery 9 Collector's Box Set!" Kind of inside jokes to fanboys (Trying to come up with analogys for DM, Might n Magic, and Wizardry on the fly isn't easy!) Or, it could be a regular guy that has no interest in this genre, and he's kind of annoyed and confused by it all. Different jokes, other side of the fanboy thing. He more makes light of the seeming lack of logic around him. "Really?! the key to that door, is CONVENIENTLY placed, RIGHT THERE, and NOONE else thinks it's wierd?!" This could be an NPC, or even party member that ends up with you. Little script checks to see if he's in your party, and "Dude! Id that King Thane's sword!? Dibs!" (More jokes of him talking in todays slang rather than "Harken thee dost thou!" as the people around him do). I imagine the novelty will wear off before long, and he will end up fitting right in, being quite competent, and less fanboy. Possibly ending up with an integral role as a normal character.
