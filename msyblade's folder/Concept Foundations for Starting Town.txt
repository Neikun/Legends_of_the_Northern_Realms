  The Designer's turn is coming up soon, and I wanted to get a some ideas/suggestions on how we are gonna start out. Here's my 2 cents:

We need to start around floor 5 to allow 2 story inns/taverns/shops, and later, may want to do a 4-5 story tower or castle.

If we start on floor 5, are we going one floor for the entire first town? I was thinking a West Side dingy, market/residential area
where the player is introduced, sent on a couple of simple of "fetch" quests, meets a base npc or 2, and establish relationships.
Eventually, unlocking the East Side of town (Floor 6?) which is upper scale/government/military style, where some action can begin.

We could do Quadrants, and go 4 floors for the starting town, (Or keep 2 reserved) because  
we could all be working on this in 6 months, adding, tweaking. . . .The First town may become Iconic of the mod also.

On this note, Can we come up with a GUI "mask" over the floor number in the map. That is going to KILL immersion.

Thinking of Item hooks that can change dialogue for "NPC"s, so they "Know" when you've beat a "Quest" More on this later.

What about an npc model, With 6-8 alcoves on him, tune them right (Ahem, NEIKUN.) and add leather/plate armor in the torso alcove,
and a diviner cap on the head alcove, etc. Multiple NPC's Immediately, and the world comes alive!
