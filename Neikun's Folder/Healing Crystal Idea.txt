How we should place Healing crystals in the game due to their potential for story confusion.

We make them only found in dungeons for the most part. Castles might have them too.
We would hide almost all of them in dungeons behind a secret of some kind.  Nothing impossible though. Low-mid difficulty secrets

Kuningas' comment: We could have altars of resurrection, which are pretty typical for games of this type. To differentiate the two, the altars could require some sacrifice to resurrect a fallen champion. Lugging the corpses all the way to temples could work also. This is almost a clicheic approach, though, but it is an established option in the genre as well.
