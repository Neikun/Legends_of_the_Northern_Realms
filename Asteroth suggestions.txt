Setting/rule suggestions
I would like a system of corruption that can accrue.Possibly similiar to JohnWordsworth's thirst(but much slower, and
depending on situation.) Probably only in some areas.(note this was just off the top of my head I don't want to force a whole new major mechanic)

Equipment suggestions
I would like some pieces of equipment that can be upgraded.
I would like equipment that can corrupt/hurt you. Even if don't use corruption.
