The Convent

Mt. Grimrock., a place of legends, towering for eons, watching as Kingdoms rose and fell in the splayed land around it.
Then, one hundred years ago, it vanished in a torrent of light and smoke.

Legend has it that the dungeon catacombs contained Grimrock were really a temple to a forgotten God,
sealed away and presided over by a corrupt priesthood known as the Goromorg. When Grimrock fell it was 
believed that the last of the forgotten Gods fell with it, and their keepers the Goromorg priesthood.

But it was not so, six years ago a strange wind began to blow out of the Storm Peaks. A wind that stinks 
of sulfur and the miasma of the grave.

Hunters go missing in the foothills, trappers in the passes.
Chanting carries on the wind and strange lights can be seen from the lower peaks of the inner range.

It's our charge to discover the origin of these disturbances, though we are not the first to receive this charge.
God willing we will be the last.
