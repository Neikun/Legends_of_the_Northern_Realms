Forest

	The woods are thick with ferns and underbrush. The canopy filters out much of the light of the sun, casting the forest in gloom. Primal energy radiates from everything around you. You carefully pick your way deeper into the forest, simultaneously alert for both predator and prey.
	The ground is rocky and heavily blanketed with moss and lichen. This must have once been the scene of a great cataclysm, and eruption or explosion. You would feel comfortable betting that before the time of men these smooth rocks were once viciously jagged.  
	Reaching the crest of a nearby mound, a flash of white catches your eye – quarry. A buck is grazing on a patch of ferns. Drawing an arrow out of it's quiver, you nock it and begin creeping towards the buck, mindful of dry leaves and dead branches.
	Forty feet, thirty, twenty. You raise the bow, draw, and loose the shaft. It finds it's mark and the buck takes off running. You follow in quick pursuit. Everything around you is a blur except for the tracks left by your prey.
	Minutes pass until you finally come across your prey. The old boy is slumped against the base of a decrepit and mostly fallen tower. Soot stained building stones, splotched with deep green moss and yellow lichen, are strewn haphazardly around the area. This place is ancient.
	Suddenly you notice that the energy in the air has changed. It's arcane, pulsing, but not threatening or uninviting. Forgetting the fallen buck not 20 feet back you make your way towards the tower. You find an entrance that looks sound enough, but the inside is very dim. Once your eyes have adjusted you look around. The isn't much, some charred timber, tumbled stones, a sapling growing crookedly from the base of the walls... and steps leading downwards. 
	There's a trail of dried, muddy footprints going down. You frown. Strange. Lifting the skinning knife from its sheath on your hip you begin a tentative advance down into the darkness.
