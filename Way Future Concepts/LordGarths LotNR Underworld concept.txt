For the map, Chaos mountain and Hex Margarth Mountain should be added and Hex Margath Mountain entrance will eventually lead to the underworld 
which will be my 3rd game.

[1:42:59 PM] Arkos: Maybe we should invite him to do his underworld dungeon of Hex Margath Mountain entrance for LotNR?  He could work on the underworld?
[1:43:41 PM] Eric Krauss: Soo... he is volunteering to build an underworld?
[1:44:35 PM] msyblade: no, he is pointing out that our map does not have that yet
[1:44:52 PM] msyblade: not sure if he volunteered the mod for LotNR
[1:45:04 PM] Arkos: yes, I'm thinking we could invite him to make an entire mod for LotNR: Underworld
[1:45:15 PM] Eric Krauss: I personally think we should start working on the overworld before we begin to think about the "underworld"
[1:45:42 PM] Arkos: I agree, but if he wants to do it...
[1:47:06 PM] Eric Krauss: I personally think not.  While I'd be grateful to see him help, we barely know where the game will be set
[1:47:39 PM] Eric Krauss: My opinion is that it is too early to be thinking about adding an entire additional map
[1:49:26 PM] Arkos: Ok, if we ever want to expand way in the future, his mountain entrance sounds interesting.
[1:49:38 PM] Eric Krauss: Indeed
[1:50:04 PM] Eric Krauss: Let's be sure to file it away under future concepts
