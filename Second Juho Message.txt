With two big kingdoms next to each other, there's always something happening in the border (Convyn is a bordertown between Theraen and Malanian empire, but belongs to Theraen). But mainly things have been peaceful for some decades. Rulers may change quickly depending the schemes in the court so some rulers are loved or hated by their people depending the ruler's mentality. I'd suppose neighboring regions's attitude towards rulers are also dependent of the ruler's aggressiveness or willing to make trade.

Ranwyn is an important trading route because it has lake and river where goods can easily shipped and then carried to Congam and from there up north along the Northern Trading Route.

We don't yet have named that many people, so feel free to invent you own. Rulers are usually referred as the Emperor, King or His Grace. But here's couple I quickly picked up from the main game:

-Magister Alarast Sage of the Royal Library of Nothampton
-Archmage Zhandul the Mad
-House Abbrarch, the ancient rulers of the vast Theareonan Empire. (Though long ago shattered, it ruled over most lands of Northern Realms)
