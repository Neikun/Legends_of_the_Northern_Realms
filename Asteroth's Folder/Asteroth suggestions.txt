Story stuff
To the mind of a tentacle, the world is in hopeless sin.
Goromorgs are forgotten. Forgotten and angry. Man, lizard, and insect will pay.(maybe rat too)
Possible raving:
Tick tock dickory dock, lock, stock and barrel. I know you, and you know me so let us sing a carol.
Click clack dickety dack. Hat pack and bedroll. I see you, and you saw me. Now hear you scream in terror.

Uttermost:
Desolate grey and depressing. The townsfolk are sad and unfreindly. They manage to survive a cold heartless
hell somehow though and are proud of that fact. The truth: They are cursed to an eternity of undead hell.
They have tied there town into ancient goromorg machines.
They used the ancient catacombs for their own ends.
Their was a tribe of minotaurs that came down from the mountains to the hills every year. Their bodies were
very resilient against cold. The locals consumed them to gain their strength.

Setting/rule suggestions
I would like a system of corruption that can accrue.Possibly similiar to JohnWordsworth's thirst(but much slower, and
depending on situation.) Probably only in some areas.(note this was just off the top of my head I don't want to force a whole new major mechanic)

Equipment suggestions
I would like some pieces of equipment that can be upgraded.
I would like equipment that can corrupt/hurt you. Even if don't use corruption.
