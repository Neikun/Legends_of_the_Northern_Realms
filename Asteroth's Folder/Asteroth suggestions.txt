Story stuff

To the mind of a tentacle, the world is in hopeless sin.

Goromorgs are forgotten. Forgotten and angry. Man, lizard, and insect will pay.(maybe rat too)

Possible raving:
Tick tock dickory dock, lock, stock and barrel. I know you, and you know me so let us sing a carol.

Click clack dickety dack. Hat pack and bedroll. I see you, and you saw me. Now hear you scream in terror.



It exists beyond the globe of our world. Wanting nothing to do with the retches who live here.

When disturbed it sends the plague of blackness, corruption to punish the hubris of man

A simple bargain. Zhandul dies or the corruption spreads



Uttermost:

Desolate grey and depressing. The townsfolk are sad and unfreindly. They manage to survive a cold heartless

hell somehow though and are proud of that fact. The truth: They are cursed to an eternity of undead hell.

They have tied there town into ancient goromorg machines.

They used the ancient catacombs for their own ends.

Their was a tribe of minotaurs that came down from the mountains to the hills every year. Their bodies were

very resilient against cold. The locals consumed them to gain their strength.



Setting/rule suggestions

I would like a system of corruption that can accrue.Possibly similiar to JohnWordsworth's thirst(but much slower, and

depending on situation.) Probably only in some areas.(note this was just off the top of my head I don't want to force a whole new major mechanic)

Familiars: Possibly have mages select familiar from gui screen. Upon which they will become a permanent inventory item.

Standard familiars I would suggest include a raven, owl(Serpentine?) or lizard/toad.



Equipment suggestions

I would like some pieces of equipment that can be upgraded.

I would like equipment that can corrupt/hurt you. Even if we don't use corruption.
