-A group of human settlers travel outward. The goal is a patch of hills near the mountain chain known as the Dearthfang
ridges. Their goal is to investigate and salvage valuable materials from the crypts contained in the hills until they can
start mining the mountains.

-The colony is fine at first. Then things turn sour. The winter is bitterly cold, far worse than expected. No life is
seen for days on end. Food stores run low. The crypts though, run deep.

-Minotaurs. They come down the mountain on a yearly ritual. The colonists had heard there were natives near by. They don't
pause or even give it a second thought strangely. The moment the group passes near they are attacked, killed and eaten.
Remains are stored for later.

-A breakthrough. The colonists find a strange area beneath the crypts. For reasons unknown at the time animals pass by 
frequently. Food is ok.

-Life becomes easier. As the villagers hoped consuming the strange minotaurs gave them the ability to withstand the cold.
They discover a machine in the strange room. They work to decipher it. Months pass trying to decipher it. Help is called
in.

-Winter is so long. The last unfortunate man is brought to this nightmare. Using what the colonists had done already it 
does not take long. Their dreams are fulfilled. It is a temperature control device. Preperations are made. The man does
not ask about the food.

-It is so coldsodarksocold. We (they?) found the truth. The minotaurs were on a pilgramage to placate the spirits in the
crypts. When the ritual was stopped the spirits, already angered by the intrusion, were enraged. They did not want us to
die anymore.ithurtssobadbecauseitissocold

-The machine trapped them (us?). It darkened the skies till there was no sun. IT is SO COLD. They are trapped by it, and
by the spirits. The blood of minos means the cold cannot kill them. If they are angry that we disturbed them then WE
WILL NEVER GIVE UP. WE (they?) WILL BE HERE FOREVER. YOU WILL NEVER REST IN PEACE.

-It is sad to never see the sun again.
