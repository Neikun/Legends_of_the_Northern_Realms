Names are made up on the spot and could be subject to change.

Thukchyr Aaltar
Mayor
A harsh, cold, and impersonal man, Thukchyr is the head of the settlers.
He sees them even in their current state as the spearhead of mankind.
While despising the pain his own people are in he is determined to make
the lives of spirits who torment them hell.



Balthasar Elvar
Wizard
The wizard brought in to unlock the machine. He is a strange old man.
Immortal by unkown means. He hates the town for trapping him in eternal
hell. His only goal is to end the pain, however rudeness and anger make
him an unconvincing employer.

Delman Bolt.
Recordkeeper
The colonists bureaucrat his job was to keep records of what was pulled
from the crypts and keep contact with the outside world. He is seen as
the 'softest' member of the group. Driven quite mad by their predicament
he now raves and dreams of escape. Delman may very well be the kindest
fellow to be found here, but even he had no protest to what the colony did.

Devara.
Essentially a de-facto nurse to the colony.
Devara acts to ease the suffering in the colony. She is neither kind nor
sadistic. She is proud of what they have done and believes that it was to
survive, and that survival should be everyones goal. She may ask for items that
aid in healing or protecting the colony, but refuses to believe that any out-
sider could understand their plight.
