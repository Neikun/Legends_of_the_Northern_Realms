This is a WIP

Would be good to get some feedback in this.
Just edit this file with your comments.


How does this perform on your computer ?

Do you feel like you are in a outside town, or does this still feel "underground" ??

Beautiful town.  Textures look nice, and it doesn't feel like underground so much as night-time town.
Unfortunately, I have no idea how it will look in daylight.  That is going to be tough, though, I presume
that it is possible given time.

Part of the underground feeling comes from the floor and the lack of light. 
Ambient lighting should have more blueness to it.
This will likely need a new ambient track. One for day time and one for night time.
Is the wood of the doors too bumpy?

Wall/pillar decorations might include sconces or tapestries

With a couple of assets (2 different signs, 1 big, 1 small, maybe a broken down hay/clay pot cart, and phitts Tables, beds, and bookcases) and some standard dungeon objects, I could make this feel like a town after stepping out of a dungeon, right now. Of course, it will be an Ogre town until we get npc's. It has that skybox/open air feel that this game needs so badly.
