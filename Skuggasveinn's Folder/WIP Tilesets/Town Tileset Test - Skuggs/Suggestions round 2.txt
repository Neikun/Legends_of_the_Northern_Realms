I'm loving the cobblestone.
The lanterns look fantastic, but I suppose they're not torchholders, eh?
I love the ground floor window.
Barrel and crate give the town more life. You should think about stilling your wide fountain in somewhere.
Something cool to do with the archways is to make a portcullis version of them. 
Interior design: Love the walls, but we'll need some variations.
Love the floor. This is looking exceptionally good.
The ceilings come together a bit strangely at the cross.
Good job adding the roof to the outdoor houses.
One last idea for a wall decoration, a wall mounted flower box.

Flower Boxes !! of course, that would be perfect for a pillar decaration also
