One other cool decoration could be an Ogre's head on a plaque.

Light beam looks a lot better than I though it did once in game.

Drakkan CITY request + ideas
1. - some kind of dirt floor (probably little grassy) - to be used for some courtyards parts, where is not stone floor
probably your forest tileset floor will be fine for it, do not know.
2. - city wall text (probably some iron small desks - should be used for streets names, etc...)
3. - required some more decorations in shops
tavern - some beer, dishes
weapon - some shelf with weapons (just decorations), anvil
armory - armor-rack
tailor - some general clothes stuff
4. - some squares decorations (fountains, statues, obelisks...)
5. missing object sx_town_ceiling_outdoors  (stone ceiling, could ber used in some tunnels etc.)
6. missing object pillar_high   (stone / wooden pillar in 2nd row)
