Thanks for giving me a torch to test the lighting further.
Note on the fountain: Looks really good, particle system should likely be moved backa  little bit and changed color. I suggest:  color0 = {0.5, 0.6, 1},

Note on  stairs: I love them, but the amount of black levels in their distance makes them seem a little less than approachable. I suggest putting a dim light source in front of them high up so they're not too well lit, but at least lit in some way.
Perhaps you will need some sort of wall decoration that looks like the part of town below. Not totally necessary, but might be interesting.

Notes on potholes: I'm so sorry to critique these as I know they took a lot of time and effort.
They should likely be more round in shape to make them look less deliberate. (More like something fell on it or something)

Since you mentioned sewers, might I get you you to work on a floor drainage for the next preview? You might even consider making on for the indoors as well. *Though a considerably small drain for indoors*

Throwing my torch at the barrel decoration causes it to be under the barrel. Not a huge problem unless throwing tiny objects maybe?
The half wall is nice, but I don't know about the full sized pillar attached to it.
Aggggh I wanna get to the other siiiide
