Just edit this file with your comments.


How does this perform on your computer ?

Do you feel like you are in a outside town, or does this still feel "underground" ??



List of things that needs to be done.

Beautiful town.  Textures look nice, and it doesn't feel like underground so much as night-time town.
Unfortunately, I have no idea how it will look in daylight.  That is going to be tough, though, I presume
that it is possible given time.
