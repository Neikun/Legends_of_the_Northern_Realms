Undeaddemon - McSkivv's Proposed Worldmap - Only reasoning used is that it includes my current WIP (see pics in my folder).

Skuggs vote : if we take a look at the assets we have available, they are all more of a northern type assets
We got the grimrock ones (originals), we have the frosen ones, etc etc.
The only one we have from the south is the southern dungeon, we dont have jungles, sand deserts or stuff like that.
So I would say lets begin more to the north then south, exacly where I leave in the hands of the writers ;)
