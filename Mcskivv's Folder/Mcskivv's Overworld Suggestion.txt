[3:09:12 PM] Eric Krauss: Hah
[3:09:37 PM] Eric Krauss: Looking at the discussion of how a single .dat file has the problem of being too large, I have this to suggest:
[3:09:55 PM] Eric Krauss: What if we went with a scaled-down overworld?
[3:10:42 PM] Eric Krauss: By scaled down I mean that a town would take up a single tile, a mountain range would only be two-three tiles thick, entire forests would be only a couple tiles, etc
[3:11:17 PM] Eric Krauss: We'd need a lot of custom tiles, but it would also enable us to get around the fact that the over world would be flat
[3:15:12 PM] Centauri Soldier: That's a really good idea! I see no reason why we couldn't do that. And then each tile represents a level in the dungeon. We could even have "Random Encounter" levels that would allow random encounters in the big map and teleport the player to the appropriate level (considering terrain for example) to conclude combat, then return. The tile could, additionally be "entered" by the player at which point the player would be teleoprted to the appropriate level for th at tile.
[3:15:42 PM] Centauri Soldier: Great idea, Eric!
[3:15:47 PM] Eric Krauss: Thanks
[3:15:59 PM] Eric Krauss: I like the random encounter idea, but I feel it would be irritating
[3:16:11 PM] Centauri Soldier: We could make it optional
[3:16:12 PM] Eric Krauss: instead, why not have roaming enemies?
[3:16:30 PM] Eric Krauss: Except, when they collide with you it teleports you to the battlefield/level/thing?
[3:16:55 PM] Eric Krauss: You could try to run, or you could fight them head on
[3:17:18 PM] Centauri Soldier: Whatever's clever. Either way is fine by me. I just like the solution for the big file.
[3:17:40 PM] Centauri Soldier: We could make the overworld as big as we want by having it occupy more than one level of the dungeon
[3:17:51 PM] Eric Krauss: Sure
[3:18:22 PM] Eric Krauss: Entrances to other "floors" of the overworld could be through mountain passes, dungeons, towns, etc
[3:19:15 PM] Eric Krauss: For instance you could head through X dungeon and when you exited it it would spit you out on another part of overworld entirely
[3:19:37 PM] Centauri Soldier: Links are fun
[3:19:45 PM] Eric Krauss: Yup
[3:19:55 PM] Eric Krauss: I think the idea is feasible enough
[3:22:19 PM] Centauri Soldier: One question...how does limit the the numer of resources in the game? Thinking about it again, doesn't it just as alter the way the player moves through the overmap? Because if each tile represents a level, we still need to use those resource to create the actual level.
[3:22:52 PM] Eric Krauss: Yes, but we can avoid creating open-feeling overworld resources
[3:23:15 PM] Eric Krauss: For instance a forest tileset is easy enough to make/get, but how would you make a hills environment?
[3:23:30 PM] Eric Krauss: What about grasslands or plains?  Lakes?
[3:23:53 PM] Eric Krauss: Other than one overworld tileset, the only other tilesets will be for points of interest
[3:25:27 PM] Centauri Soldier: I see, so you're attempting to exclude most of the overworld tileset.
[3:25:32 PM] Eric Krauss: Yes
[3:25:57 PM] Centauri Soldier: I wonder how much that would reduce the size of the resource folder..
[3:26:12 PM] Eric Krauss: This will cut down on the amount of tilesets while increasing terrain variety and decreasing the amount of floors the .dat file encompasses
[3:27:44 PM] Eric Krauss: Perhaps it will only decrease the size of the mod by a couple hundred megs, but it is a place to start
[3:27:51 PM] Centauri Soldier: I agree
[3:28:10 PM] Centauri Soldier: Plus, I reall ylike the idea in gerneral, despite its capacity to reduce size
[3:28:51 PM] Eric Krauss: I like the idea because we can cover far more terrain with far less time and effort
