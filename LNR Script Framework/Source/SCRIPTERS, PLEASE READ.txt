So, here's the framework.
It's not quite complete but the skeleton is up.
Please check the wiki for coding cenventions to before editing any files.
If the conventions do not suit you, let's all talk and find something that works for all of us.
I think it's very important that we all agree on the same methods and are all on the same page.


Please feel free to add your modules to the framework.
Also, the idea of the framework is that the methods work together so
feel free to integrate your new methods into existing ones where appropriate.

The LNRSM utility in here is an auto-update program that ports the source files (the
ones you're editing when you're writing code) in real-time to the code usable
by the dungeon in you're currently working. It updates the code every few seconds
so you'll see changes as soon as you reload your dungeon. Just run the utility as it sits
but please remember to shut it off during your commits and syncs. I will be updating the utility
soon with several improvements.
