Drakkan - any comments here pls
This is just my first test with this tileset. It is not definitely finished - missing some objects like statutes, fountains etc...
but overall it should work like that.
I already requested Skugg with some objects to make (like text_object etc...)
There is few quests to finish (starting in tavern approaching the woman) it is just for fun, not sure if ever implemented.

v2
stars
new quest in armory
two endings and some dialogue stuff

First of all, that was the first time I saw the city tileset in action. Makes me want to try it as well, it is simply amazing.

I've tried to keep a critical standpoint, but also noted particular high-spots.

Notes:

-Good that you gave me (You?) trousers at the beginning, would've hated walking into the tavern naked, only to be joined by a mysterious young woman.

-Very thin alleys; it was hard to discern between houses and made it feel a little more like a maze. Fitting for certain towns, but something to look at. A few broad streets will also make alleys more imposing and effective.

-Loved the gardens and such small, nice spots

-Sky is dark. Consider adding a few particle effects floating there the create a better illusion of space. Stars are another option, or a nightly skybox now that it is possible to us. On the topic of particles, some fog on the street can also look good, but is in no way required.

-Ways to discern houses better required modeling/texturing wise.

-The quests and the names of the locations appearing are a rather nice touch, although I don't really like the way the game prints to the lower edge of the screen. Perhaps a small location indicator on the upper part of the screen?

-Mapping requires walking almost every single step possible: a possible place for a feature request, minimap control. That way we can reveal and hide certain things.


Also a general comment not really limited to this build:

-Roofs for smaller houses would be a nice addition -- looking up the buldings are majestic, but the streetlevel looks dungeonish at times.

brief Drakkans coment - thin alleys - definitely good point, could make wider for next city
dark sky - I wonder what happened with starsky_objects. When I started editing city it was everythere, but then it "dissapeared"
somehow and I was lazy to add this object on every square. Also not sure if this will not cause major lagging.
Hudprinitng - yep agreed. I need some text signs on the wall, where streest names will be printed
