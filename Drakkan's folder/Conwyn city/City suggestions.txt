Drakkan - any comments here pls
This is just my first test with this tileset. It is not definitely finished - missing some objects like statutes, fountains etc...
but overall it should work like that.
I already requested Skugg with some objects to make (like text_object etc...)
There is few quests to finish (starting in tavern approaching the woman) it is just for fun, not sure if ever implemented.

v2
stars
new quest in armory
two endings and some dialogue stuff

First of all, that was the first time I saw the city tileset in action. Makes me want to try it as well, it is simply amazing.

I've tried to keep a critical standpoint, but also noted particular high-spots.

Notes:

-Good that you gave me (You?) trousers at the beginning, would've hated walking into the tavern naked, only to be joined by a mysterious young woman.

-Very thin alleys; it was hard to discern between houses and made it feel a little more like a maze. Fitting for certain towns, but something to look at. A few broad streets will also make alleys more imposing and effective.

-Loved the gardens and such small, nice spots

-Sky is dark. Consider adding a few particle effects floating there the create a better illusion of space. Stars are another option, or a nightly skybox now that it is possible to us. On the topic of particles, some fog on the street can also look good, but is in no way required.

-Ways to discern houses better required modeling/texturing wise.

-The quests and the names of the locations appearing are a rather nice touch, although I don't really like the way the game prints to the lower edge of the screen. Perhaps a small location indicator on the upper part of the screen?

-Mapping requires walking almost every single step possible: a possible place for a feature request, minimap control. That way we can reveal and hide certain things.


Also a general comment not really limited to this build:

-Roofs for smaller houses would be a nice addition -- looking up the buldings are majestic, but the streetlevel looks dungeonish at times.

brief Drakkans coment - thin alleys - definitely good point, could make wider for next city
dark sky - I wonder what happened with starsky_objects. When I started editing city it was everythere, but then it "dissapeared"
somehow and I was lazy to add this object on every square. Also not sure if this will not cause major lagging.
Hudprinitng - yep agreed. I need some text signs on the wall, where streest names will be printed



///////thomson's comments/////////////
The new tileset and new props look great. I really like them, but I do not want
to repeat the compliments others were giving. Here are my comments:

There is a light glitch. The light shines through the walls. Stand at 11,23 and
look south (at 11,25).

"Its dark here" => "It's dark here" ("its" is possessive form or it. "it's" is
a contration of "it is")

as usually => as usual.

Why can't I steal torches? "This is not your property" is a poor excuse. I'm an
an asipring thief, why can't I steal a torch? It would be better if you allow
to steal one torch, and it spawns a partol looking for torch thief. After that
the player could comment "I better not steal another one". You can make it more
belivable if the first torch stolen has very short burn time (there's a call 
setFuel() for that). The player could comment. "Why bother? Stealing another
one would bring more patrols and they are worthless anyway".

Quest for bringing 3 metal parts. It is largely unbalanced. 150 exp vs full
helm - 150xp is 2,5 snails killed :(

After compliting the quest there's no "sorry, I'm busy." or "I don't have
anything more for you".

"Note from Agen" => "Agent"

Tailor left a note that he's out to tarven, but he really is in the Inn. 

It was not obvious that I need to put the gems on the table before the inn
keeper.

There's a visual glitch when you enter the tavern walking backwards (looking at
the courtyard).

There's a visual glitch when you go up the stairs in the tavern and in tailor's
house.

Light rays cast from the windows, up in the tavern look amazing from distance,
but there are unpleasant patches of light and dark texture when looked up close.

"Be quite" => "Be quiet"

The final of the map is glitchy.

- when Yennifer runs away, there's information to return to thieves guild.
  There's nothing that can be triggered there.
- I found 2 ways to bring green smaragd to thieves guild:
  a) keep the smaragd in the mouse pointer
  b) throw it through the stairs
  Bringing the smaragd to thieves guild does nothing (i put it in the alcove,
  but there is no reaction)

There are several other small typos in various texts.

In general, great map with a lot of potential. It feels a bit unfinished, but
I understand that as it is a demo.
