If you have any comments, ideas or whatever you can insert it here.

Conwyn city is just my test with Skuggs city tileset + some widgets usage from thomson.
It is NOT completed mod, it contains just few quest for Guild, which could even be not used when released to LotNR later on.
Enjoy.

I will upload source soon.
