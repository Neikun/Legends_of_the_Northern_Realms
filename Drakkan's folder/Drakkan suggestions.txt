my ideas:

Starting place
does not matter, depends on story.

starting party
best option should be give player opportunity to create party. However if some race will be required for some game progress, no problem to define


Hiring Inn possibility ? Just idea
One starting character defined. Next characters could be hired in town Inn´s. These inns should be like "save party" rooms, where player could
pick which members he /she wants to have for now. Anytime player could here drop some member and hire differnet.
