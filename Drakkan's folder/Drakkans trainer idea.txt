Trainers

Regular building in town, where player could go and train (buy) skill he wants. Each town should have one or more trainers.
Each trainer is able to train some specific skills. For example City of XXX wll have just trainer Swift John, which is
able to provide training in skills like Dodge, Athletic etc... another city should have some master-mage who is able to train
skills like fire-magic or earth magic, but he doesn not know ice magic of course. For that you need visit Icy tower where lonely
mage is living and could train you... etc...


In game - it should work simply - buying tomes. TOme +1 for skill player want to buy for X gold coins. thats all
As skills are probably the "most wanted" it should be overpriced.
